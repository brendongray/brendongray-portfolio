# Assignment 3 & 4 - Data Critique

## The Original Visualization

For this assignment, I chose a data visualization from the policy advocacy non-profit New Mexico Voices for Children. I chose this visualization first because NM Voices does a lot of policy work in New Mexico, my home state. The visual comes from the 2020 "KIDS COUNT" databook, published annually. It's indended for state lawmakers and policy practitioners, especially those working in education policy. The visualization below caught my attention because it presented an interesting relationship between two variables. I thought it could be improved because it wasn't easy to draw conclusions on first glance, but I thought it had important implications.

## The Redesign Process

### Step 1: Preliminary Sketching

The first step in my redesign process was to find the original data. I was able to download the original data from from Map the Meal Gap. I started to read about the data and quickly saw information that may not have made it to the final publication visual. After this step, I started making a list of ways I could represent the relationship between the percent of households receiving SNAP and child food insecurity. I quickly sketched a scatterplot and thought I was on to something. I wrangled my data into Excel and started exploring. Before I knew it, I had 4 - 5 scatterplots, each comparing different variables. 

Unfortunately, this was a mistake. The relationships were complex and unclear. Simple scatterplots were not going to do the data justice, and I realized just how far I was outside the realm of my expertise. Further, I realized that the more complicated I made my redesign, the more likely it was that I misrepresent the information. I took a step back from the software and returned to the suggested work flow in the textbook. 

### Step 2: Discussing

After the Excel distraction, I consulted with my roommate. Like suggested in the textbook, I started talking generally about what I was working on. My roommate's questions started getting the gears turning in the right direction. I showed her some of my sketches, and she suggested I stay away from a scatterplot. She (rightly) identified there was no clear relationship between the two. Even if there were, the sample was too small to draw any conclusions (n = 30). 

We talked for about 20 minutes and I made about 1/4 page of notes. Toward the end of our conversation, she made a very good point: the reader was most likely to care about their county. A bar chart would be best because it conveyed clear information about a single geographic point. That information could be contrasted to the rest of the information, but the info would be important because it represented something personal. I agreeded. This reminded me of Evan Peck's "Data is Personal. What We Learned from 42 Interviews in Rural America."

Further, I identified in the critique phase that the report's intended audience was policymakers. Policymakers were most likely to care about what the situation looked like for their constituents. If there were actionable policy outcomes tied to the data, they would be best supported if the problem was visualized in their county.

### Step 3: Redesigning

I opened my data into flourish studio and began experimenting. Because I had already decided on a bar chart format, this portion of the assignment actually took the least amount of critical thinking. By this point, the visualization was mostly a matter of adding specific elements to help tell the story better. There were three instances of this:

  1) Adding color. I added color to the counties with the highest rates of child food insecurity. My idea was for the reader to
