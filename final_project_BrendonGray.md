# Final Project Outline

## High Level Summary
For my project, I want to highlight some of the consequences federal redlining policies have on the current Pittsburgh housing market. I am particularly interested in demonstrating the differences across the redlined "border," where adjacent neighborhoods had different access to lending and where those effects are born in the market today.

# The Data

The data for my project comes from two sources. First, redlining maps from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) are available from the [Mapping Inequality Project of the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58). These maps have been geocoded and are downloadable directly from the website. Housing market data is publically available from the [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC)](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/real-estate-sales) and contains all property transactions since 2013. The redlining maps and the property sales data can be spatially joined for analysis. Lastly, I plan to download data from the 2010 decennial census and the 2019 American Community Survey for high-level demographic information. These will both be accessed through the Census's publically available data [website] (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).

Once fully cleaned, I plan to use Tableau to build maps with various levels of granularity. For example, while I plan to display the property sales as individual geographic points, my primary visualizations will involve aggregating data to neighborhoods, Census tracts, or Census block groups. I have (limited) experience with this type of aggregation and manipulation using GIS packages in R.

# Methods

I plan on using Shorthand to publically present my story. Most of my data visualizations will be built in Tableau. I imagine creating basic tables for some visualizations in Canva. I have chosen Shorthand as my medium instead of a mapping-making platform like ArcGIS Story Maps because I want the focus to be on the story, not the map. Because I do not have the capability nor experience to build out fully integrated map data, I would like the reader to draw conclusions primarily from the non-map features of the story, such as well-designed timelines and tables. The maps, while helpful, will be a highlight to these primary storytelling devices.
