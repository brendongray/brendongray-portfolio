# Final Project Outline

## High Level Summary
For my project, I want to highlight some of the consequences federal redlining policies have on the current Pittsburgh housing market. I am particularly interested in demonstrating the differences across the redlined "border," where adjacent neighborhoods had different access to lending and where those effects are born in the market today.
