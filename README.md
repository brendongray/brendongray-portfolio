# About me
My name is Brendon Gray. I use he/him pronouns. I'm originally from Albuquerque, NM, land of green chile and the world's largest hot air ballon fiesta (pictured below!).

I'm in the flagship MSPPM program, and I'm working toward a career in state or local government. Outside of school and work, I love to read, write, and cook. 

# What I hope to learn
My primary goal for this class is to strenthen my process of making data visualizations. I'm guilty of having used sloppy Excel bar charts for professional presentations, and I'd like to be able to analyze and quickly improve a visualization. I'd also like to practice my feedback skills as visual mediums can be particuarly hard to critique.
