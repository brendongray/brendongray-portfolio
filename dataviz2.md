**Comments**

This visualization is clear and easy to interpret. The color scheme is professional. However, it does not convey how debt-to-GDP is changing across time, which may be important for some audiences.

This data viz is also strong. It enhancnes the first graph by incorporating a time component. I find the abbreviated country names to be disorienting, though someone with more international policy experience likely would not.

**Comments** 

In this visualization, I tried to emphasize the change in debt-to-GDP ratio. I thought this was the most interesting element in the grid of lines chart. After experimenting with a few options, I settled on the dot plot with arrows. The goal is for readers to quickly understand the time dimension (2000 to 2018), then start to draw conclusions. After settling with this version, I made improvements by modifying the color scheme. The default Flourish configuration was for the arrows to have a dark blue hue. I found that distracting, and I think the grey arrow shade makes the overall effect much more subtle.
